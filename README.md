upWork demo

Easiest way how to run tests is:
- download and extract .zip file
- Install Chrome
- Get visual studio 2015 (community version)
- Add SpecFlow plugin to visual stuido
- Open solution
- Rebuilt it - VS download missing packages, theres a possibility than after packages donwload SpecFlow did not recognize feature files well, and you need to open solution again
- Run unit test by proper interpret (MsTest or ReSharper)

In last point can be a problem, you need to download this interpret and make him working. In case you dont want to do this, i can show you runing tests via any program with screen sharing.
In case i get the work, we can discuss how to run tests on demand
