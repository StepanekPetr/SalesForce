Easiest way how to run tests is:
- Install Chrome
- Get visual studio 2015 (community version)
- Add SpecFlow plugin to visual stuido
- Open solution
- Run unit test by proper interpret (MsTest or ReSharper)

In last point can be a problem, you need to download this interpret and make him working. In case you dont want to do this, i can show you runing tests via any program with screen sharing.
For me theres no point to make tests running on some cloud server with prepared environment. In case i wont get this work, it be a big lost of time for me.
